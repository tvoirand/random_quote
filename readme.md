# Random Quote

This small project consists in displaying randomly selected quotes in a webpage.

When reading books I sometimes write down passages that I like.
I had the idea of storing these passages (that I call here "quotes") in a database stored in my personal website, and displaying one of these randomly when accessing the webpage.

The result is available here: [thibautvoirand.com/random_quote](https://thibautvoirand.com/random_quote)
